<h1>Everit OSGi Eclipse Plugin</h1>

<p style="color: red;">Please note that a complete user guide will come later</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>EOSGi Eclipse plugin displays OSGi environments specified with <a href="http://www.everit.org/eosgi-maven-plugin/">eosgi-maven-plugin</a> in the Project Explorer view of Eclipse and lets the user managing the environment by using a context menu. The user can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start the OSGi environments specified in the pom file of the project</li>
  <li>Debug the OSGi environments</li>
  <li>Live upgrade of the OSGi environments</li>
  <li>View the console of the OSGi environment within Eclipse</li>
  <li>Stop the environments gracefully (even if the environment is stopped from console or debug view)</li>
  <li>Call the <a href="http://www.everit.org/eosgi-maven-plugin/sync-back-mojo.html">sync-back</a> goal of the maven plugin on an environment</li>
</ul>

<p>If an OSGi environment is managed with the Eclipse plugin, dependencies are resolved from the workspace with the following algorithm: If a dependency is imported as a maven project into the workspace, the plugin executes <i>mvn package</i> on that dependency and installs the result JAR file to the OSGi container.</p>

<p>When an OSGi environment is started in debug mode by the plugin, the sources are resolved by the dependency manager of maven. If a dependency is available on the workspace as a project, the source is picked up from there.</p>
